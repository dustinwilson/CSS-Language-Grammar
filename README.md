# CSS TextMate Language Grammar #

This is an alternate CSS language grammar for TextMate 2. It is designed to be more extensible and allow other [language grammars such as SCSS][a] to be built upon it. The language grammar is specifically for TextMate 2. It will not work in TextMate 1 or other programs which have borrowed TextMate's language grammar system. TextMate 2 has new features this language grammar takes advantage of.

## Installation ##
